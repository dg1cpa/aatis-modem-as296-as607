Problem 1:
Since Kernel 2.6.16 the developer changed the USB-System.
The LEDs don't switch of after you connected the modem to the computer.
This is NOT an as296-tty driver Problem.
We now search the Bug in the Firmware/Kernel.
Solution:
Use Kernel 2.6.15
or send your as296-CPU to AAtis to exchange the firmware to "1.0h"

Problem 2:
./usb-as296-to-tty-d: relocation error: ./usb-as296-to-tty-d: undefined symbol: usb_detach_kernel_driver_np
kissattach: open: Input/output error
Solution:
Please install an new libusb http://libusb.sourceforge.net/download.htm

Problem 3:
No DAMA support in Debian Kernels per default
Solution:
Recompile the kernel with Dama_Slave [x]
or use Kernel 2.6.21 or newer
